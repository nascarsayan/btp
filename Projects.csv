Under this circumstance it is extremely important for businesses to maintain authenticity of information and develop technology to detect early signs of fraudulent behaviour. 

In this project our goal is to study large scale review corpus and investigate utility of sequence models such as LSTM  in differentiating fake and real reviews. More specifically let’s assume that a review is a sequence of characters, and each subsequence has two states i.e either useful or misleading. Our goal is to learn a model which will output a score for each state for the entire review by leveraging sequential patterns and help us in classifying it as fake or real. We would also like to investigate how the standard features based models reported in the literature compare with our DL models.

,AM2,Animesh Mukherjee,,PG,Automatic prediction of exaggeration in health news using deep learning models,"Exaggeration detection, deep learning",1,"News articles are the primary source of health-related information for a large chunk of common people, although these pieces of information first appear as scientific articles in health-related journals. This is because, unlike scientific articles, the news articles are written in simple language that can be easily understood by the general public. News agencies and journalists rely on the published scientific article and the associated press release for the content. However, while putting information in a news article they, knowingly or unknowingly, often exaggerate the facts and claims. Automatic detection of exaggeration in a news article can help the general public to be cautious while reading its content. In this work, we plan to explore the syntactic, semantic and latent features (word2vec, doc2vec etc) that could potentially detect exaggeration. Also, we will examine LSTMs and memory networks based techniques to build a classifier based on top of these features that can accurately detect if a news article is exaggerated and at which level it is exaggerated.",

In recent years, the study of citation network has gained immense popularity among social network researchers. The number of citations to a paper determines its popularity among researchers. We specifically choose table citations along with the total citation counts to answer the following questions since papers when cited in tables are generally because of some improvement done on the cited paper or because of some dataset offered by the cited paper. In this study we aim to find the effect of table citations on the popularity of a paper, its temporal citation count, how new techniques are improving upon old techniques with time. In this research we aim to answer the following questions:
0. Extract table citations from paper pdfs (using CNNs as they do for image extraction). Exploit various NLP techniques post extraction to build accurate table structures.
1. Can we efficiently predict the future citation count using present citation count and
present table citation count?
2. Do papers having high citations, tend to share their citations with papers which cite

,AM5,Animesh Mukherjee,,,Topically aware chatbots,Seq-2-seq learning,1,"Chatbots have boomed in the last few years with the resurgence of Deep Learning. Unlike the traditional Chatbots which work on structured input, these new era Chatbots can take natural language queries as input and produce appropriate output. These nascent Chatbots still lack several key features like personality, consistency in reply etc... In this project, we will be tackling some of these issues. Particularly, we will look into the following problems:

1. Personality Traits: One of the main issues while conversing with the Chatbot agent is the lack of a personality. For example, if you ask the Chatbot 'Are you a girl ?', it responds with 'Yes'. Again, if you ask 'Are you a boy ?' it will respond with 'Yes'. The lack of such personal attributes can be troublesome. We will look at ways in which a Chatbot will be able to learn several personality traits automatically using Deep Learning.

2. Topic based conversation reply: Another issue with open-domain Chatbot is that most of the responses to questions are very generic like ' i don't know'. while these responses serve the purpose, they can be improved easily by incorporating topical information into the Chatbot. Here, we will be using a topic hierarchy to generate responses that will look more 'natural and satisfactory'.",

Edges with positive signs represent friendship whereas those with negative signs represent enmity between corresponding pair of users in a signed social network. While the problem of mining unsigned social networks containing only positive links has been extensively studied over the years, methods used for mining unsigned networks cannot be simply extended for mining signed networks due to the existence of negative links. Research shows that negative links have significant added value over positive links for various analytical tasks in signed networks. The collective properties of positive and negative links can be explained by social theories such as balance theory and status theory.

,BM2,Bivas Mitra,,,Dynamics of information diffusion in Twitter,"Social networks, Complex networks, ML",1,"Twitter is currently one of the most popular microblogging platforms for the dissemination of information in the form of messages called tweets. Users can reshare tweets with their own set of followers via retweets that exposes the tweet content to followers who can in turn further retweet the post leading to the formation of an information cascade. In this way, information diffusion takes place over the underlying follower network of Twitter. Study of the dynamics of information diffusion in Twitter can benefit a number of applications such as community detection, identification of highly influential users and viral marketing among others. Whereas majority of previous works have relied on network topology to explain the mechanism behind diffusion of information, temporal data available in cascades can be used to model the diffusion dynamics of a tweet over different parts of the Twitter network. In this project, we aim to leverage on temporal pattern of retweets to identify key users in the network that are influential in maximizing the spread of a cascade to a larger audience without requiring the information of the complete follower network.

The app monitors typing and swyping activity and also opportunistically asks for emotion ground truth by issuing survey questionnaire. Then it extracts different features from typing and swyping data and correlates them with the emotion ground truth to develop an emotion detection model. The model is constructed on the device itself. As smartphone is a resource-constrained device, it is required to develop suitable training strategies so that there is trade-off between energy consumed and accuracy obtained. Moreover, as the app collects data regarding typing and mental states, it provides useful insights on mental health for self-reflection to the user.

However, risks of insider attacks/cross-VM escalation privileges often motivates clients to encrypt their data before transferring to the cloud. Searchable encryption is a technique that allows analytical operations on encrypted data without decrypting it. Searchable encryption is currently one of the most engrossing challenges in cryptography, with immense scope for both theoretical and practical explorations. 

Hidden Vector Encryption (HVE), introduced in 2007, is a public-key searchable encryption paradigm that allows conjunctive, range and subset queries over encrypted data. While several concrete constructions for HVE have been proposed till date, most of them use a cryptographic primitive called bilinear pairings. These schemes usually have security guarantees based on non-standard cryptographic assumptions. It is currently an open problem to construct HVE schemes in the public-key setting that do not use pairings.

The aim of this project is to design public-key HVE schemes that do not use pairings. While recent breakthrough works have provided some nice mathematical hints in this direction, the problem itself is unresolved and offers significant design challenges.

,DM2,Debdeep Mukhopadhyay,,, Hardware Accelerators for Searchable Encryption,Cryptography and Hardware Design on FPGAs ,1,"The advent of cloud computing has enabled provisioning of computing resources and storage infrastructure to multiple clients on a given network anywhere across the globe. At the same time, it poses the risk of exposure of sensitive data to malicious agents via insider attacks/ corss-VM attacks/privilege escalations etc. Such attack vectors often cause clients to encrypt their data before offloading it to the cloud. Searchable encryption is a technique that allows data encryption while retaining the capability to perform analytic operations such as keyword search/phrase searches, which is not possible in traditional encryption schemes. Widespread deployment of such schemes require efficient implementations, and offers a great scope for hardware acceleration. The scope of hardware acceleration in searchable encryption has relatively unexplored in existing literature, but offers immense potential for fast and scalable designs.  

In this project, we aim to design efficient hardware accelerators and hardware-software co-proccesor based architectures for searchable encryption. The deliverables include RTL-level designs targeting the 7-series of Ultrascale FPGAs. The schemes would be subsequently deployed on clusters of multiple FPGAs, and tested for search performance on large-scale real-world databases.

Virtually everything, starting from our smartphones to next-gen automotive systems contain cryptographic modules implemented in hardware, software or both to ensure the security of all information processing tasks. Design and implementation of such cryptographic modules are however tricky as they themselves must be proven secured, both theoretically as well as at the implementation level. Even the implementations of well-known cryptographic schemes suffer from the threats of side-channel and fault-based attacks, which are nowadays found to be extremely potent and practical.

Identification and mitigation of such malicious faults are extremely important as they can be exploited by attackers.

However the difference in timing between a cache hit and miss can lead to leakage of secret keys, through attacks which are called as cache attacks. In the SEAL Lab, we have been working from 2008 to develop several interesting forms of cache attacks, namely cache timing, cache access and cache trace.We have attacked several ciphers ranging from the popular AES to proprietary ciphers like Clefia, designed by SONY Corporations. These attacks are affected by the development of micro-architectures. In recent days, Intel has developed two new generation of architectures: 1) Intel SGX and 2) Intel I9. The former is Intel's response to privilege escalation attacks, where the adversary gains root access to compromise systems. This technology became popular from 2015 and was called  Software Guard Extensions (SGX) that creates secure containers, so called
enclaves, to protect applications against access from higher privileges, including the OS kernel. The I9 is a new micro architecture introduced by Intel which make major changes the cache subsystem, with a potential to thwart cache attacks. Both these platforms provide new opportunities of evaluation of the threat from cache timing, which the project would investigate.

,DM5,Debdeep Mukhopadhyay,,,Block Chains for IoT,"Internet of Things, Cryptography",1,"Internet of Things(IoT) is a network of physical objects-devices, vehicles, build-
ings and other items which are embedded with electronics, software, sensors,
and network connectivity, which enables these objects to collect data and ex-
change data. We are all witnessing the growth of IoT at an astounding rate,
and it is believed to continue its momentum in future as well. However, there
are several challenges facing the IoT solutions which must be addressed to make IoT bigger, more secure and private.

Blockchain is a database that maintains a continuously growing set of data
records which is distributed in nature. There is no central or master computer
that holds the control of entire chain, and each node has a copy of the chain.
The chain is ever growing where only new records can be added and previous
records can't be changed (at least it will require astronomical amount of work).
When someone wants to add a transaction to the chain, all participating
nodes in the network will have to rst validate it. The condition for \validity
""depends on Blockchain system, and thus might differ from system to system.
However, it works on the principle of 'majority wins'. A set of valid trans-
actions is then bundled into a block, which gets sent to all the nodes in the
network. They, in turn, validate the new block based on the principle of `Proof
of Work'(POW). Each successive block contain a hash, which is a unique 
fingerprint of the previous block.

It is believed by many that the Blockchain may be the silver bullet to solve
many of the problems of current IoT and it may settle the security, privacy and
reliability concerns in IoT. To mention a few, Blockchains can be used to trace billions of connected devices, enable the processing of transactions and coordination between them. Thus, it can be used to overcome the scalability issue in IoT. Its decentralized nature eliminates single point failure concerns, and cryptographic protocols used in Blockchain would make consumer data secure
and private. 

However, the block chain brings forth several new challenges in the form of scalabililty, large storage requirement, and the fact that the IoT has several nodes with different processing powers. The present proposal looks at these challenges and investigates on how to make block chains more apt for IoT. Experimentations will be performed in the IoT lab on real devices and appliances. ",

In this project, we'll try to explore whether we can leverage smartphone's microphone to understand such context or environment. Audio signals, though is prone to noise, has arrived as a significant source of information. Various works ranging from single user detection to complex room occupancy detection has already been done and presented successfully. In most of the cases, a significant amount of audio preprocessing is done, and various techniques like FFT and filtering techniques come into play. Sophisticated features extracted using techniques like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) have also been used in many recent works.   The inclusion of various statistical models like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have further refined the outputs produced by these systems.
However, such process are not very robust for on-device implementation on a smartphone, or prone to noise for omnidirectional microphones, which are mostly present in modern day's smartphone.
