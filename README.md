* Prerequisites : `prettytable`<br>
`pip2 install prettytable`

Now there arises 2 cases : 
1. You want to know what's the overall distribution<br>
`python btp.py`
2. You want to see what seats are available for you<br>
`python btp.py 15CS*00**`<br>
Where the last arg represents the roll number of the guy below you.<br>
